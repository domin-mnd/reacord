# Links

In Discord, links are a type of button, and they work similarly. Clicking on it leads you to the given URL. They only have one style, and can't be listened to for clicks.

```jsx
import { Link } from "reacord"

function AwesomeLinks() {
	return (
		<>
			<Link label="look at this" url="https://google.com" />
			<Link label="wow" url="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
		</>
	)
}
```

See the [API reference](/api/index.html#Link) for more information.
